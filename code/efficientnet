EfficientNet is a convolutional neural network built upon a concept called "compound scaling.‚Äù This concept addresses the longstanding trade-off between model size, accuracy, and computational efficiency. The idea behind compound scaling is to scale three essential dimensions of a neural network: width, depth, and resolution.
Width: Width scaling refers to the number of channels in each layer of the neural network. By increasing the width, the model can capture more complex patterns and features, resulting in improved accuracy. Conversely, reducing the width leads to a more lightweight model, suitable for low-resource environments.
Depth: Depth scaling pertains to the total number of layers in the network. Deeper models can capture more intricate representations of data, but they also demand more computational resources. On the other hand, shallower models are computationally efficient but may sacrifice accuracy.
Resolution: Resolution scaling involves adjusting the input image's size. Higher-resolution images provide more detailed information, potentially leading to better performance. However, they also require more memory and computational power. Lower-resolution images, on the other hand, consume fewer resources but may lead to a loss in fine-grained details.
